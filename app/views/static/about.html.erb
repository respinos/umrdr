<h2>About Us</h2>

<p>The datasets that underlie research findings are increasingly in demand. Funding agencies require that research data be discoverable, accessible and preserved for future use. Publishers ask for data sets to be included alongside of publications as supplemental files to support research findings. Researchers seek out existing data sets to test out new theories or generate new discoveries.</p>

<p>In response, The University of Michigan Library has developed Deep Blue Data, a repository for sharing and archiving research data that were developed at the University of Michigan. Deep Blue Data is a component of a suite of services provided by the UM Library designed to broadly disseminate the intellectual contributions in research, teaching and creativity made by the University of Michigan community and to ensure its longevity.</p>
